### Motivational introduction
Functional languages are founded on the idea of function 
composition; having $f: A \longrightarrow B$ and 
$g: B \longrightarrow C$ we can create a composition
$g \circ f: A \longrightarrow C$.
Suppose now those functions have some additional, common
flavour e.g. they may not return a result (like $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ for $x=0$) or return 0 or more results (like for a function computing possible chess positions from a given position).

In a strongly typed language we'd represent this additional behaviour by
a different type of the return value. Let's stick to the example of 
possibly not returning a value. We'd introduce a type constructor `Maybe`, $M$ for short, and our functions would have signatures $f:A \longrightarrow MB$ and $g:B \longrightarrow MC$.

We still do want to compose them; the additional behaviour should not hinder us, they both have it. But now the types are incompatible. We want 
to apply $g$ after $f$ but $g$ accepts type $B$, not $MB$. We are stuck. Monads are a device to break this impasse, let's keep this in mind for the rest of the section.

Taking a step back, another thing besides composition of functions that we would can employ is the identity function $id: A \longrightarrow A$, a trivial computation for any type $A$. Now, it turns out that there is a mathematical structure built on top of these two properties called a category.

It belongs to Category Theory, a mathematical area that tries to describe things in the most general way possible. Thus the definition of a category is very simple: 
> A **category** $\mathcal{C}$ is a collection of: 
> 1. **objects** $A, B, \ldots$
> 2. **morphisms** or **arrows** (which you could think of as maps)
>
> where the morphisms have the objects of $\mathcal{C}$ as domain and codomain, e.g. $f:A \longrightarrow B$. The morphisms of corresponding domains and codomains have to be composable in the way you'd expect and each object has its **identity morphism** $id_A:A \longrightarrow A$ that acts trivially in the composition. 

For more details refer to [Johnstone notes].

Now, further into Category Theory, there is a notion of a **monad**. Regardless of what is its mathematical definition (refer to 5.1 in [Johnstone notes]), a monad $M$ on a category $\mathcal{C}$ gives us another category, the **Kleisli category** $\mathcal{C}_\mathbb{T}$, whose morphisms are morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$ of the form $f:A\longrightarrow MB$. The fact that it's a category means we can compose those morphisms. This is what we wanted all along and this is what monads give us.

### What is a monad?

Much in the spirit of the above reasoning, the definition of a monad in
computer science as given by [nLab] is as follows:
> A **monad** is a map $M$:
> 1. sending every type $X$ of a given programming language to a new type
$MX$.
> 2. equipped with a rule for composing two functions of the form
$f: X \longrightarrow MY$ and 
$g: Y \longrightarrow MZ$ to $gf: X\longrightarrow MZ$.
The functions are called **Kleisli functions** and the composition the **Kleisli composition**.
> 3. together with a map $\mathrm{pure}_X: X\longrightarrow MX$
for every type $X$ that acts trivially in the composition.
The Kleisli composition is required to be [associative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property).

A definition offered by [Haskell All About Monads] is more down to earth:
> A **monad** is:
> 1. a type constructor $m$
> 2. a function building values of type $m$, $a \longrightarrow ma$ for any type $a$ called **return**
> 3. a combinator function called **bind** of the form $(ma, a \longrightarrow mb)\longrightarrow mb$ for any type $a, b$. Usually written $ma >== a \longrightarrow mb$.

The definition above has to also satisfy the laws equivalent to the third point in the nLab's definition.


### Examples of monads in programming languages

### Background
The term **monad**, from Greek *monas*, "unit", was first used by Giordano Bruno.
He claimed the world is *homogeneous*, *one*. Nevertheless, it consists of a multitude
of self-contained units. Like a point, *mathematical minimum*, is a basic component of space,
and an atom, *physical minimum*, of that of matter - monad is a *metaphysical minimum*. Their
shapes and formes are unique (which followed naturally from God being the ultimate perfect
creator).
