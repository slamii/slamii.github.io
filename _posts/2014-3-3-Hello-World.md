# Why?
Functional programming languages are founded on the idea of function 
composition; having 
{% raw %}
$$f: A \rightarrow B$$
{% endraw %}
and 
{% raw %}
$$g: B \rightarrow C$$
{% endraw %} we can create a composition
{% raw %}
$$g \circ f: A \rightarrow C$$.
{% endraw %}
Suppose now those functions have some additional, common
flavour e.g. they may not return a result or print something in addition
to returning it.

{% raw %}
  $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ --> note that all equations between these tags will not need escaping! 
{% endraw %}
